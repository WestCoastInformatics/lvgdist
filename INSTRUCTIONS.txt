When ready to push a next version

* First check for the latest version of the staging plugin
  * https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.sonatype.plugins/nexus-staging-maven-plugin
* Ensure the private key is properly configured


* If your version is a release version (does not end in -SNAPSHOT) 
  and with this setup in place, you can run a deployment to OSSRH 
  and an automated release to the Central Repository with the usual:

mvn clean deploy

* With the property autoReleaseAfterClose set to false you can manually
  inspect the staging repository in Nexus and trigger a release of the 
  staging repository later with

mvn nexus-staging:release

* If you find something went wrong you can drop the staging repository with

mvn nexus-staging:drop

* To deploy a SNAPSHOT, simply run "clean deploy" with a -SNAPSHOT version

* To deploy a release, remove -SNAPSHOT. Once you have updated all the 
  versions and ensured that your build passes without deployment you can
  perform the deployment with the usage of the release profile with

mvn clean deploy -P release


Updating to new version, use this process:

* Develop, develop, develop
* Commit any outstanding changes
* Verify build passes
* Update versions to release version
* Commit release version
* Run deployment
* Update versions to next snapshot version
* Commit new snapshot version
* Develop, develop, develop and rinse and repeat

Alternatively, maven release plugin could be used.
